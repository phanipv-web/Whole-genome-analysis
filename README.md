#Merops analysis
## Methods summary
Proteins were searched against the MEROPS pepunit library using DIAMOND BLASTP.
High-confidence hits were filtered by e-value (≤1e−10) and coverage.
MEROPS families were assigned from database headers and summarized at family level.
Figures were generated using matplotlib (Arial Black, 1000 dpi).
